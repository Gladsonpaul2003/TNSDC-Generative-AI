The natural language processing (NLP) project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model to analyze and classify customer feedback into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques and deep learning algorithms, the project will preprocess raw text data, train and fine-tune the sentiment analysis model on a diverse dataset of customer reviews, and evaluate its performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy and precision. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide businesses with actionable insights derived from customer sentiment analysis, enabling them to make data-driven decisions, improve products and services, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
